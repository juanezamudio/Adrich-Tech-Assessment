# Algorithm Challenge

## Code

Check my assessment code by clicking on `algorithm_challenge.py` and `algorithm_challenge_tester.py` to see my unit tests.

I tried to cover as many test cases that I could think of but please let me know if I happened to miss one.

## Testing

After cloning my assessment to your local computer, run the following command-line command to see that my unit tests pass:

`python -m unittest -v algorithm_challenge_tester`

**Note:** Make sure that you are in the proper directory.
